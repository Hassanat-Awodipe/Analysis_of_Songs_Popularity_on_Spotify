Sub-components for our work could be found in individual branches.

The main branch consists a jupyter notebook with all our code (analysis_of_song_popularity.ipynb) and csv files for our data collection (Spotify: track*, Wiki&Kaggle: artist*, Lyrics: lyrics*), source combination (combined*), data cleaning (final*).

Because this is a class project, it also includes presentation slides, project report and meeting minutes.
